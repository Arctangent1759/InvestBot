How to make sense of all these folders
======================================

bin/
----
Binary files generated by compilation. The git settings of this 
project are set to ignore anything in this directory. 

Running 
make
will create a binary called runner in this directory that runs 
src/main.cpp.

Running
make test
will create a binary called tester in this directory that runs
test/tester.cpp.

build/
------
Build contains object code generated by make. The git settings
of this project are set to ignore anything in this directory.

doc/
----
Documentation you may right for various parts of this project.
It is our end goal to have a usable bot that people outside of the 
development team can learn how to use, so be sure to properly
document your libraries.

include/
--------
Contains all header files. Place all C++ headers (.hpp) and C headers
(.h) here. Most code in this directory should be well-documented and 
properly interfaced for the ease of use of other people on this 
project.

lib/
----
Contains libraries outside of the C++ and C standard libraries that 
we might need.

sandbox/
--------
Directory for screwing around with C++, experimenting with data 
structures, etc.

src/
----
Contains all implementation files. Place all .cpp files here.

test/
-----
Contains unit tests. Eventually, there should be a tester.cpp file 
here.
